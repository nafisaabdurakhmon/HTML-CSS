    <h1>BUKHARA TEXT</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Bukhara (/bʊˈxɑːrə/ buu-KHAR-ə;[2] Uzbek and Tajik: Бухоро, romanized: Buxoro, pronounced [buχɒrɒ]; Persian: بخارا) is the seventh-largest city in Uzbekistan by population, with 280,187 residents as of 1 January 2020.[1] It is the capital of Bukhara Region.[3] The mother tongue of the majority of people of Bukhara is the Tajik dialect of the Persian language,[4] although Uzbek is spoken as a second language by most residents.</li>
        <li>2Bukhara, city, south-central Uzbekistan, located about 140 miles (225 km) west of Samarkand. The city lies on the Shakhrud Canal in the delta of the Zeravshan River, at the centre of Bukhara oasis. Founded not later than the 1st century CE (and possibly as early as the 3rd or 4th century BCE), Bukhara was already a major trade and crafts centre along the famous Silk Road when it was captured by Arab forces in 709. It was the capital of the Sāmānid dynasty in the 9th and 10th centuries. Later it was seized by the Qarakhanids and Karakitais before falling to Genghis Khan in 1220 and to Timur (Tamerlane) in 1370. In 1506 Bukhara was conquered by the Uzbek Shaybānids, who from the mid-16th century made it the capital of their state, which became known as the khanate of Bukhara.</li>
        <li>3Bukhara, which is situated on the Silk Route, is more than 2,000 years old. It is the most complete example of a medieval city in Central Asia, with an urban fabric that has remained largely intact. Monuments of particular interest include the famous tomb of Ismail Samani, a masterpiece of 10th-century Muslim architecture, and a large number of 17th-century madrasas.</li>
