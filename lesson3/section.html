           <em> During the rule of Bukhara emir Haidar
            
            After the death of Amir Shahmurad, his son Haydar took the throne (1800–1826). Some regional rulers took advantage of his inexperience and tried to disobey the central authority. However,<mark>Amir Haydar managed to break the resistance</mark>  of most of them and subordinated them to the central authority, although with great difficulties. Termination of independence of most regions increased the stock of state land. This has led to an increase in the number of people who rent state land. This factor contributed to the rapid growth of the economy of the emirate. During the reign of Amir Haydar, the domestic and foreign trade of the country also increased. Amir Haydar was one of the most learned rulers of his time. He knew the Holy Quran by heart. Religious and scientific discussions were often held in the presence of Amir. The number of students from foreign countries has increased in Bukhara madrasahs</em></p>

        <p><b>The Kalyan Minaret (Uzbek: Minorai Kalon, Persian/Tajik: Minâra-i Kalân, Kalon Minor, Kalon Minaret[2]) is a minaret of the Po-i-Kalyan mosque complex in Bukhara, Uzbekistan and one of the most prominent landmarks in the city.
            The minaret, designed by Bako, was built on an earlier existing structure called Kalyan by the Qarakhanid ruler <span style="color: brown;"> Arslan Khan in 1127 to </span>summon Muslims to prayer five times a day. An earlier tower was collapsed before starting this structure which was called Kalyan, meaning welfare, indicating a Buddhist or zoroasterian past. It is made in the form of a circular-pillar baked brick tower, narrowing upwards.<mark>It is 45.6 metres (150 feet) high (48 metres including the point), of 9 metres (30 feet)</mark>  diameter at the bottom and 6 metres (20 feet) overhead.   
            There is a brick spiral staircase that twists up inside around the pillar to the rotunda. The tower base has narrow ornamental strings belted across it made of bricks which are placed in both straight or diagonal fashion.[3] The frieze is covered with a blue glaze with inscription</b></p>

        <p><i>Nearly four-fifths of Uzbekistan’s territory, the sun-dried western area, has the appearance of a wasteland. In the northwest the Turan Plain rises<span style="color: blueviolet;"> 200 to 300 feet (60 to 90 metres)</span> above sea level around the Aral Sea in Karakalpakstan (Qoraqalpoghiston). This terrain merges on the south with the Kyzylkum (Uzbek: Qizilqum) Desert and farther west becomes the Ustyurt Plateau, a region of low ridges, salt marshes, sinkholes, and caverns.
            Southeast of the Aral Sea, small hills break the flatness of the low-lying <b>Kyzylkum Desert,</b> and, much farther east, a series of mountain ridges partition Uzbekistan’s territory. The western Tien Shan includes the Karzhantau, Ugam, and Pskem ranges, the latter featuring the 14,104-foot (4,299-metre) Beshtor Peak, the country’s highest point. Also part of the western Tien Shan are the Chatkal and Kurama ranges. The Gissar (Hissar) and Alay ranges stand across the Fergana (Farghona) Valley, which lies south of the western Tien Shan. The Mirzachol desert, southwest of Tashkent, lies between the Tien Shan spurs to the north and the Turkestan, Malguzar, and Nuratau ranges to the south. In south-central Uzbekistan the Zeravshan valley opens westward; the cities of Samarkand (Samarqand) and Bukhara (Bukhoro) grace this ancient cultural centre</i></p>
